# Anime App

This project is a JavaFX application called Anime Search App. The app lets users find information about different anime shows and movies. Users can search for anime by entering the title in the search bar. The app connects to the OMDb API to get information about the anime, such as the title, year, genre, plot, and poster image.

Main Features:
Search Anime:

Users can search for anime by typing the name into a text field.
The app displays the search results in a grid format with anime posters and titles.
View Details:

Users can click on an anime to see more details like the release year, genre, plot, and IMDB rating.
Favorites List:

Users can add or remove anime from their favorites list.
The app has a separate view for users to see their favorite animes.
User Interface:

The app uses a clean and simple user interface with a modern look.
It includes a navigation bar, buttons, and images to enhance the user experience.
Technical Details:
JavaFX: Used for building the user interface.
OMDb API: Used for fetching anime data online.
JSON: Used to process and display the data received from the API.
Maven: Used to manage project dependencies and build the project.
This project helps me practice Java programming, work with APIs, and learn about JavaFX for creating GUI applications.
